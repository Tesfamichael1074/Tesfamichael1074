I am a very passionate Flutter developer with more than 2 and a half years of experience. I am experienced in creating and developing new features of mobile applications and also very much skillful in shipping them to different groups with high satisfaction. I have good experience in developing sleek performance applications with a well-managed state and pixel-perfect UI/UX implementation. 

I usually follow MVVM design patterns to develop any Flutter application effectively. In terms of state management, I have extensively used Provider and RxDart to organize and abstract specific functionalities and services. With provider patterns and higher-order service components, I have been able to write a modularized and organized code that is easy to reuse and maintain.

Since my college major was Computer Engineering I can integrate any kind of hardware device to work with any Flutter apps. I also have good experience in developing apps with backend REST API built in any framework. I work with Cross-Functional groups and this experience has taught me about commercialism and tactful movement.

I have developed many mobile apps, an Arduino Kit manual application for TME Education (Poland), NFT walet tracking app called TokenHead for Aloha EOS (US), Customer service app called MidYaf for GhostDevelopers (Pakistan), and an app called ASTRA ERP for Poshak consultancy services PLC, to name the few.

ASTRA ERP which is an ERP application that is a client-side application for a big ERP software that was designed and developed by Poshak Consultancy Services PLC. The application was developed for the apparel industry to manage the whole workflow of the company including Attendance, Real-time employee performance, Real-time company Cost estimation, Virtual packing, Job allocation, Lost time registration, and so on. 
 
I have developed a full-scale application from design to development that has an integration with a very big API which was also designed by me.  In addition to my mobile application development skills, I also have a good experience in back-end API development with Loopback.JS and Django.
